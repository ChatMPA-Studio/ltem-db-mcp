"""Per-investigator API key auth, enforced by FastMCP's own auth layer.

Wired through FastMCP's `auth=` hook as a `TokenVerifier` subclass, so
*every* HTTP request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <key>` — including
the orchestrator's internal calls, which previously passed unauthenticated
(the old Starlette middleware let header-less requests through and relied on
the security group alone). FastMCP's transport middleware now rejects a
missing or malformed header before this module is reached.

Deliberately NOT `JWTVerifier`: these keys are opaque, not JWTs. An admin
panel elsewhere generates a random key, shows it once, and stores only its
SHA-256 hash in DynamoDB alongside the investigator id and scopes. This
module never sees or stores a raw key — only the hash, and only in memory,
only for AUTH_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS. Subclassing `TokenVerifier` keeps that
lookup exactly as it was; only the surrounding plumbing changed.

Scope enforcement is declarative: `required_scopes` on the base class makes
FastMCP reject tokens lacking AUTH_REQUIRED_SCOPE. Rejections surface to the
client as a standard OAuth 401 (`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer ...`), so the
specific reason (unknown / revoked / missing scope) stays in the logs rather
than the response body.
